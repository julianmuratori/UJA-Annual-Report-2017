				<h2>Over the last 100 years UJA Federation has made incredible things happen that have changed the course of the Jewish People worldwide.</h2>
				
				<p>We were on the frontlines of freeing Soviet Jewry, we helped with the immigration of thousands of Ethiopians to Israel, we strengthened our most vulnerable, we built community centres and schools, we fought for the independence of Israel and supported the founding of the state and the people who made it their home.</p>
				
				<h2>We are a community that is stronger together</h2>

				<p>Our strength lies in our shared commitment to make sure that every Jewish person has the opportunity to flourish and succeed. While we look back with pride at our achievements, we also look ahead with great excitement towards a bright and sunny future.</p>

					<h2>Letter from UJA Federation Leadership</h2>
				</div>

				<div class="width50">
					<p>The Jewish community of Toronto can trace its roots back to the 1800s. As the Jews of Eastern Europe, living under oppression and persecution, fled their towns and villages, many arrived in Toronto seeking freedom where they would be able to openly and joyously celebrate their Judaism.</p>

					<p>In 1917, Toronto’s first Jewish federation – the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies – was incorporated, replacing the unorganized collection of individual Jewish charities, each knocking on doors and collecting funds for their own causes.</p>

					<p>As Toronto’s Jews became an increasingly organized, unified force, so too did their dreams. Understanding that the Jewish community would continue to grow due to the waves of immigration flooding into Toronto, their dreams, and the dreams of UJA Federation, turned to building a city – a community – where Jews could flourish and succeed</p>

					<p>Fast forward to a century later and UJA Federation is celebrating its Centennial, onehundred years of providing leadership, philanthropy and service to the Toronto and global Jewish communities, we continue to do the work we started a century ago. And, with a network of more than 100 partner agencies, we continue to transform the lives of Jews in Toronto, Israel and across the Jewish world.</p>

					<p>After all, it’s our tradition.</p>

					<p>Appreciatively,</p>

				<h2>COMMUNITY BUILDING</h2>
				
				<p>Sheff Family Building ground-breaking: On October 15th, 2017, we held the long awaited groundbreaking for the expanded home of the of the new Sheff Family Building, the future home of the expanded Prosserman Jewish Community Centre on Bathurst Street, just north of Sheppard Avenue.</p>
				
				<p>The fully completed 27 acre Sherman Campus, located in the heart of the Carscadden Greenbelt, will be able to provide a robust offering of programs including swim and fitness classes, youth groups, arts and culture programs, and the return of the summer camp, among many other programs and social services, all in an effort to expand the current offerings and reach of the campus within the community.</p>
				
				<p>“Community Centres are so important to our neighbourhoods. It’s where we come together as a city. This centre will provide a sense of community, bring neighbours together and connect people by acting as a space for recreation and community gatherings.”</p>
				<p> - Toronto Mayor John Tory</p>

				<h2>DISASTER RELIEF</h2>
				
				<p>Hurricane Irma Relief: In response to this tragedy, our compassionate and generous community came together, raising more than $52,000 to help victims of Hurricane Irma.</p>

				<p>Hurricane Harvey Relief: We were able to raise more than $112,000 which was part of a North American-wide effort with our partners at the Jewish Federations of North America that raised $14 million in total.</p>

				<p>The funds provided emergency aid and relief in the immediate aftermath of the Hurricanes and are also being used to rebuild infrastructure, restore synagogues and assist day schools. None of this could have happened without the support of our donors.</p>
