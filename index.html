					<p>The Jewish community of Toronto can trace its roots back to the 1800s. As the Jews of Eastern Europe, living under oppression and persecution, fled their towns and villages, many arrived in Toronto seeking freedom where they would be able to openly and joyously celebrate their Judaism.</p>

					<p>In 1917, Toronto’s first Jewish federation – the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies – was incorporated, replacing the unorganized collection of individual Jewish charities, each knocking on doors and collecting funds for their own causes.</p>

					<p>As Toronto’s Jews became an increasingly organized, unified force, so too did their dreams. Understanding that the Jewish community would continue to grow due to the waves of immigration flooding into Toronto, their dreams, and the dreams of UJA Federation, turned to building a city – a community – where Jews could flourish and succeed</p>

					<p>Fast forward to a century later and UJA Federation is celebrating its Centennial, onehundred years of providing leadership, philanthropy and service to the Toronto and global Jewish communities, we continue to do the work we started a century ago. And, with a network of more than 100 partner agencies, we continue to transform the lives of Jews in Toronto, Israel and across the Jewish world.</p>

					<p>After all, it’s our tradition.</p>

					<p>Appreciatively,</p>

				<p>Sheff Family Building ground-breaking: On October 15th, 2017, we held the long awaited groundbreaking for the expanded home of the new Sheff Family Building, the future home of the expanded Prosserman Jewish Community Centre on Bathurst Street, just north of Sheppard Avenue.</p>
				
				<p>The fully completed 27 acre Sherman Campus, located in the heart of the Carscadden Greenbelt, will be able to provide a robust offering of programs including swim and fitness classes, youth groups, arts and culture programs, and the return of the summer camp, among many other programs and social services, all in an effort to expand the current offerings and reach of the campus within the community.</p>
				
				<p>“Community Centres are so important to our neighbourhoods. It’s where we come together as a city. This centre will provide a sense of community, bring neighbours together and connect people by acting as a space for recreation and community gatherings.”</p>

				<p>Hurricane Harvey Relief: We were able to raise more than $112,000 which was part of a North American-wide effort with our partners at the Jewish Federations of North America that raised $14 million in total.</p>

				<p>The funds provided emergency aid and relief in the immediate aftermath of the Hurricanes and are also being used to rebuild infrastructure, restore synagogues and assist day schools. None of this could have happened without the support of our donors.</p>

					<p class="spanBold">The Issue:</p>
					<p>In recent years our Jewish Day Schools have seen a decrease in enrollment between grades 8 and grades 9. We have conducted a large scale research project and identified the rising cost of tuition contributed directly to a decrease in enrollment numbers.</p>

					<p class="spanBold">How we helped:</p>
					<p>Through innovative thinking and strategic partnerships we have managed to secure $15 million in gifts which managed to reduce tuition at TanenbaumCHAT by 30%.</p>

					<p class="spanBold">Impact:</p>
					<p>The tuition decrease led to a 90% retention rate from the north campus of TanenbaumCHAT, and enrollment has increased by 40 students in the first year of the amalgamated southern campus.</p>

					<p class="spanBold">The Issue:</p>
					<p>Jewish Torontonians increasingly struggle to make ends meet and, in the GTA alone, approximately 24,000 Jews live in poverty including 5,000 seniors, many of whom are Holocaust survivors, and 4,000 children. Poverty in our community is on the rise with many experiencing significant challenges finding gainful employment or launching careers. Many are still lacking basic necessities such as food, clothing, housing and transportation. Those with mental and physical illness, people with disabilities, new immigrants, seniors and Holocaust survivors, and families where both parents are working are all affected by poverty and this seriously restricts participation in Jewish communal life.</p>

					<p class="spanBold">How We Helped:</p>
					<p>Over this past year, as part of our efforts to combat Jewish poverty, we allocated over $7,000,000 to 11 social service partner agencies while working with them to identify and understand the needs of our vulnerable community members.</p>

					<p>Over the past 70 years, we have forged a strong bond with the State of Israel with investments in Aliyah and absorption, vulnerable populations, education, healthcare and cutting-edge technology.

					<p>For the past 13 years, Sderot has suffered considerably by living with the threat of daily rocket attacks.

					<p>Fortified Sderot’s Community Center (as a JFC-UIA National project); developed a strong, vibrant Youth Department for Sderot, now fully operated by the municipality; stabilized formal and informal activities and services in the city, over the years, in times of peace.</p>

In partnership with Federations and Hillel Ontario, CIJA launched a campaign that mobilized over 12,000 Ontarians to contact their MPP in support of the motion</p>

				<p class="spanBold">Impact:</p>

				<p>By passing this motion and condemning BDS as a form of bigotry, The Ontario Legislature has sent a clear message that BDS has no place in our province.</p>

					<h2 class="color-yellow spanBold relative">JEWISH IDENTITY<img src="./public/images/making_identity.png" class="absolute identity-absolute" alt=""></h2>

					<p class="spanBold">The Issue:</p>

					<p>How do we create a Jewish journey for our children? One of our focuses this year was on Jewish Summer Camps. Camping is a magical experience deeply impacting kids’ Jewish identity. However, for first timer children and parents overnight camp can be an intimidating prospect. There was a need to increase awareness and enrollment for full sessions at Jewish Summer camps, especially for younger children.</p>

					<p class="spanBold">How We Helped:</p>

					<p>UJA Federation piloted a new program called The Weekender. The Weekender, sponsored by the UJA’s Silber Family Centre for Jewish Camping, is designed to introduce first time campers to Jewish overnight camp in a safe and fun 2-3 day session. It is a fully sponsored innovative program which allows children entering Grades 1 to 6 to get a taste of Jewish summer camp</p>

					<p class="spanBold">Impact:</p>

					<p>In its first year, The Weekender managed to introduce 180 children to their first summer camp
					experience. The program has surpassed its initial goal by 20%. Follow up surveys participants show a strong intention to enroll into summer camp in subsequent years</p>

					<p class="spanBold">The Issue:</p>

					<p>How do you bring a community together to celebrate 100 years of UJA Federation in Toronto?</p>

					<p class="spanBold">How We Helped:</p>

					<p>Over a year of planning came to fruition. More than 350 community members departed on the biggest mission in our community’s history. UJA Federation’s Centennial Journey to Israel was a culmination of the many creative minds, hearts and souls of our amazing professional staff at UJA, as well as our partners in Israel and our amazing clergy and outstanding lay leaders.</p>

					<p class="spanBold">Impact:</p>

					<p>Over 350 community members were able to forge a deeper and stronger connection to the work of UJA Federation, not only in Israel but locally and around the world. This will affect fundraising and volunteer recruitment for years to come.</p>

				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="wrapper-inner flex highlights-container">
				<div class="width50">
					<p class="spanBold">As 2017 comes to an end we are looking forward to the innovative projects we have already set in motion for next year. Here is a glimpse into the exciting work UJA is making happen in 2018.</p>

					<h2 class="color-primary-light spanBold">JEWISH COMMUNITY</h2>

					<p>Israel will be turning 70 in April of 2018. Planning is already under way as we get ready to	celebrate 7 decades of Israel’s independence. We will be partnering with organizations throughout the city to bring our community a variety of events that showcase Israel’s culture and the diversity of our community. The festivities will ulminate in 2 marquee events, one taking place on April 19th, to celebrate Yom Haatzmaut and the other at UJA’s Walk with Israel which will be taking place on May 27th. The Walk brings out more than 20,000 community members who will come	together to celebrate Israel and the Toronto Jewish Community.</p>
					
					<h2 class="spanBold color-purple">JEWISH POVERTY RELIEF</h2>

					<p>DoortoDoor, a Collective Impact initiative, funded by our generous donors for the most vulnerable Jewish seniors and Holocaust survivors, will help provide vital resources to the social services they need. The approach is a game changer for the community in how organizations will work together and take a systemic approach to meeting the needs of our community’s most vulnerable.</p>

					<p>DoortoDoor is a unique model, connecting our agencies through a centralized outreach and access point, to help them identify and reach out to those in need, by matching them with critical supports and services. Through a web portal, DoortoDoor leverages a sophisticated call centre and information and referral hotline to provide a connection to our Jewish social services. This program is set to launch in 2018.</p>

					<h2 class="spanBold color-orange">JEWISH ADVOCACY</h2>

					<p>Your Ward News, a hateful and blatantly antisemitic paper, has long been a source of deep concern to members of the Toronto Jewish community. The paper promotes racist, homophobic, misogynist, and pro-Nazi material. Last year, The Minister of Public Services, Judy Foote has issued an order forbidding Canada Post to deliver Your Ward News. It appears that the paper is now being delivered by private distributors, as printed copies have recently resurfaced across the GTA. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="width50">
					<p>CIJA, represented by a member of CIJA Toronto’s Legal Task Force, has status at the hearing, and we are taking the position that the order be permanent. It is our sincere hope that the board will uphold the Minister’s decision, and that not a single copy will be delivered by Canada Post in the future</p>

					<h2 class="color-green spanBold">JEWISH EDUCATION</h2>

					<p>UJA’s Koschitzky Centre for Jewish Education is reimagining the landscape of Jewish education. Start-up grants have been made available for Jewish content before and after care programs that will provide both a Jewish education and meet the childcare needs of families.</p>
					
					<h2 class="spanBold color-teal">CONNECTIONS TO ISRAEL</h2>

					<p>The lay and professional leadership of the Israel and Overseas Committee will be developing and launching a new and exciting strategic investment portfolio which will guide UJA Federation’s giving for the next few years.</p>

					<p>In Israel: We will continue to support STEM education for children in the under-served communities in Israel with most of our efforts focusing on communities in Bat Yam, Sderot and Eilat / Eilot. These will include support given to the Cyber Development Fund, Robotics classes for kindergartens and elementary schools, advanced STEM classes in junior and high schools; and inspiring students to make the most of their potential through upgrading labs, academic tutoring and inspiring field trips.</p>

					<p>Overseas: Our work continues to support relief for vulnerable Jewish communities in Eastern Europe and South America and strengthen ties between the Jewish Community of Greater Toronto, Israel and eastern Europe through a variety of Israel engagement programs and Jewish young leadership programs.</p>

					<h2 class="spanBold color-yellow">JEWISH IDENTITY</h2>

					<p>As part of our work to increase engagement among emerging adults, we will be launching a new Birthright post-engagement strategy with a strong focus on relationships. The intent of the strategy is to ensure that the Birthright trip is also a portal to involvement with Toronto’s Jewish community once participants return from Israel.</p>
